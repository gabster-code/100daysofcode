- Learned about GAS Fees
    - Pre-London Upgrade
     - gas fees = gas spent * gas price
    - Post-London Upgrade
     - gas fees = gas spent * (base fees + priority fees)

--------------------------------------------

Day 3 and 4 - 08/29/2022
- Learned how ethereum transactions are Mined 
    - User Signs transaction request
    - transaction is broadcasted to the Network
    - transaction gets added to the local mempool of the nodes (mempool = list of trans. not yet included as part of a block)
    - miner groups transation into blocks
        - verifies validity of transaction
        - executes transation on local copy of EVM
        - miner begins process of creating POW certificate
    - after producing POW Certificate, it broadcasts to the Network
    - other nodes verify the certificate, execute all transactions in the block to local EVM and checks if EVM state matches the one proposed by miner
    - once other nodes verified, they add block to the node and accept the new EVM state as the current state of blockchain
    - Each node removes transactions included within the block from their local mempool
    - repeat 😎
- Learned about Mining types and what proof of work is
    - Ethereum proof-of-work protocol, Ethash
- Learned more about the EVM
